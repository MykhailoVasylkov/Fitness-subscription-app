## Rationale

Fithub was developed to solve a common problem: people want to stay fit, follow structured workout and nutrition plans, and track their progress — all in one place. However, many existing platforms either focus only on selling products or only on training plans, lacking a unified experience.

Fithub brings together e-commerce functionality, personalized training plans, and community interaction in a single platform.

### Target Audience

- **Fitness enthusiasts** who want to buy equipment and follow professional workout or nutrition plans.
- **Beginner users** looking for guidance and motivation through community features.

### Project Goals

- Provide a **user-friendly shop** with filters for category, brand, price, rating, etc.
- Allow users to **purchase and follow workout/nutrition plans**, with real-time progress tracking.
- Create a **community space** where users can post updates, like and comment on others’ progress.
- Enable **profile customization** and tracking of order history, training progress, and personal data.
- Support a **complete checkout process** with email confirmations and order status updates.

## Overview
FitHub is an all-in-one fitness platform where users can purchase a wide range of fitness products, including apparel, nutrition plans, and exercise programs of varying difficulty levels and durations.

Each purchased plan is accessible on the user's profile page, where users can track their progress by marking completed stages. These updates are shared in real time on the Community page, fostering engagement and motivation among users.

The Community page also allows users to create, edit, and delete posts, making it a dynamic space for sharing experiences and staying inspired. Additionally, users can leave reviews on both products and fitness plans, helping others make informed decisions.

FitHub combines shopping, training, and community interaction in one seamless experience to support users on their fitness journey.

## Design

The design employs a vibrant and modern color palette to create a visually engaging and user-friendly experience:

### Color Scheme:
The navbar is highlighted with a clean white background paired with black font for high contrast and readability. In contrast, the main content area and footer feature a rich purple gradient, lending the site a sleek and professional look. This purple background works well with white font to maintain strong contrast and visual appeal. The combination of crisp white/deep purple balances vibrancy with elegance.

### Hero Section:
A full-screen background photo with a subtle parallax effect is used in the hero section to immediately capture the visitor’s attention. This dynamic visual element sets the tone for the site, creating an immersive and engaging first impression.

### Accent Elements:
Interactive components such as buttons, filters, back-to-top buttons, and forms use bold, contrasting colors including white, red, green, blue, and orange. Borders and corners throughout the site feature rounded styling to ensure a consistent and friendly visual language. Circular avatar icons complement this rounded design aesthetic.

### Typography:
The primary typeface selected is **Lato**, a clean, modern sans-serif font known for its excellent readability and friendly yet professional appearance. The font is predominantly displayed in white when placed on dark backgrounds to maximize contrast and legibility, while black is used on lighter backgrounds for a balanced and accessible text presentation. This choice supports both clarity and contemporary style across the site.

### Navigation & Interactivity:
The navigation menu is fixed to the top of the viewport, ensuring constant accessibility as users scroll through the page. Interactive feedback such as focus states enhance usability and provide a polished user experience.

### Consistent & Responsive Design:
The website is designed to be responsive, so it works well on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. The layout adjusts to different screen sizes to keep the site usable and visually consistent.

### Wireframes:
Initial wireframes were drafted to plan the overall layout and functionality of each page, guiding a smooth development process and helping visualize the end product. However, due to time constraints, some functional simplifications were made during development, resulting in a final product that differs somewhat from the original wireframe designs.

This design focuses on simplicity, accessibility, and a modern aesthetic, delivering a visually appealing and user-friendly experience for all visitors.

# Deployment procedure

## Windows Setup Guide: Python, Git, VS Code & Virtual Environment

### Step 1: Install Python on Windows

#### Open the Command Prompt

- Press `Windows + R`
- Type `cmd` and hit Enter
- In the Command Prompt, type: ```echo Hello, world!```

- Press Enter — you should see: `Hello, world!`

#### Check if Python is Already Installed

- In the Command Prompt, type:
```
python3 --version
# or
python --version
```

- If you get an error or Python is not version 3.12.x, install it below.

#### Install Python

- Go to:  
  https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.8/python-3.12.8-amd64.exe
- Download and open the installer
- In the installer:
  - Check **Add Python to PATH**
  - Click **Install Now**
  - If prompted, click **Disable path length limit**
  - Restart your computer if asked

#### Verify Installation

- Reopen Command Prompt (Win + R → `cmd`)
- In the Command Prompt, type:
```
python3 --version
pip3 --version
# or try:
python --version
```

If both commands return version 3.12, Python is ready!

---

### Step 2: Install Git

#### Check if Git is Installed
- In the Command Prompt, type:
```
git --version
```

- If you see `git version 2.x.x`, Git is already installed.  
- If not, follow the steps below.

#### Identify Your Windows System Type

- Press `Win + R` → type `msinfo32` → Enter
- Find **System Type**:
  - `x64-based PC` = 64-bit
  - `x86-based PC` = 32-bit

#### Download Git

- Go to:  
  https://git-scm.com/downloads/win
- Choose installer:
  - 64-bit: Click under **Download for Windows**
  - 32-bit: Click **32-bit Git for Windows Setup**

#### Install Git

- Open the downloaded installer
- Leave all defaults **unless you're sure**
- On these screens, ensure:

  - That **Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software** checked
  - That **Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings** checked

- Finish installation. Close any Git release note tab.

#### Verify Git Installation

- Reopen Command Prompt:
- In the Command Prompt, type:
```
git --version
```

#### Setup Git Identity
- In the Command Prompt, type:
```
git config --global user.name "YourGitHubUsername"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
git config --list
```

Make sure your name/email appear.

---

### Step 3: Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

#### Check If VS Code is Installed

- Press `Windows + S` → Type **Visual Studio Code** → Enter
- If it opens, you're set.

#### Install VS Code

- Go to:  
  https://code.visualstudio.com/download
- Download for Windows and run the installer
- During setup:
  - **Add 'Open with Code' to context menu**
  - Click **Next → Install**

#### Verify VS Code Installation
- In the Command Prompt, type:
```
code --version
```

Restart your machine to finalize.

---

### Step 4: Set Up and Activate Virtual Environment

#### Part 1: Create Project Folder

- Open VS Code → `File > Open Folder`
- Create and select a new folder
- Click **Yes, I trust the authors**

#### Part 2: Create Virtual Environment

- Click settings on the bottom-left → Command Palette (or press `F1`)
- Type `create environment` → Select **Python: Create Environment...**
- Choose **Venv**
- Select Python version (preferably 3.12)
- `.venv` folder appears in explorer

In terminal:
- In the terminal, type:
```
pip freeze         # should show nothing
python3 --version  # should match selected version
# if not:
python --version
```

#### Part 3: Connect to GitHub

- Go to [GitHub](https://www.github.com)
- Click **+** → **New Repository**
- Use same name as your VS Code folder
- Click **Create repository**

In terminal:

- Copy GitHub’s setup commands and paste in terminal

Authorize Git Credential Manager if prompted.

Refresh GitHub page — you should see your repo.

---

### Step 5: Tidy Up with `.gitignore`

- In VS Code, create a new file: `.gitignore`
- Add the following lines:

```gitignore
.venv
env.py
```

Do **not** push `.venv` to GitHub — it’s large, system-specific and easily recreated.

---

### Step 6: Confirm Environment is Active

- Create a file: `test.py`  
- On the Bottom you should see:  
  `Python 3.12.x (.venv)`

If not:

- Go to **File > Close Folder**
- Reopen folder via **File > Open Folder**
- Open `test.py` again — you should see `.venv` active in the status bar


## Setup Instructions and Environment Variables Configuration

#### Open Terminal  
**In the powershell**  
- `git clone https://github.com/MykhailoVasylkov/Fitness-subscription-app`  
- `cd Fitness-subscription-app`  
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`  

After installing dependencies, create a file named `env.py` (add to the **.gitignore**) in the project root. It should contain the following environment variable settings:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault(
    "DATABASE_URL",
    " ",  # URL to your database connection string. Typically obtained from your database provider (e.g. PostgreSQL, MySQL).
)

os.environ.setdefault(
    "CLIENT_ID",
    " ",  # Google OAuth 2.0 Client ID for enabling Google login. Get it by registering your app in Google Cloud Console under OAuth 2.0 credentials.
)

os.environ.setdefault(
    "SECRET",
    " ",  # Google OAuth 2.0 Client Secret for enabling Google login. Get it by registering your app in Google Cloud Console under OAuth 2.0 credentials.
)

os.environ.setdefault(
    'SECRET_KEY',
    ' '  # Django's SECRET_KEY used for cryptographic signing. You can generate one using online generators.
)

os.environ.setdefault(
    'STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY',
    ' '  # Your Stripe Publishable Key, available in your Stripe Dashboard. Used for client-side Stripe integration.
)

os.environ.setdefault(
    'STRIPE_SECRET_KEY',
    ' '  # Your Stripe Secret Key, available in Stripe Dashboard. Used for server-side Stripe API calls. Keep it secret.
)

os.environ.setdefault(
    'STRIPE_WH_SECRET',
    ' '  # Stripe Webhook Signing Secret to verify incoming webhook events. Found in your Stripe Dashboard under Webhooks.
)

os.environ.setdefault('DEVELOPMENT', '1')  # Set to '1' to indicate development mode, or '0' for production.

os.environ.setdefault(
    'AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID',
    ' '  # AWS Access Key ID for accessing Amazon S3. Get it from your AWS IAM user credentials.
)

os.environ.setdefault(
    'AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY',
    ' '  # AWS Secret Access Key paired with the Access Key ID. Keep this secure.
)

os.environ.setdefault(
    'USE_AWS',
    'True'  # Set to 'True' to enable AWS S3 for media/static files storage, or 'False' to disable.
)
```

#### Notes:  
Keep all secret keys and credentials private and do not commit `env.py` to public repositories.  

Obtain all necessary keys and URLs from the relevant service providers (Google Cloud Console, Stripe Dashboard, AWS IAM, and your database provider).

---

1. **Apply Database Migrations**  
Run the following command to apply all pending migrations to your database:  
```powershell
python manage.py migrate
```  
This ensures your database schema is up-to-date with your Django models.

2. **Create a Superuser (Admin Account)**  
Create an admin user to access the Django admin panel:  
```powershell
python manage.py createsuperuser
```  
You will be prompted to enter a username, email, and password.

---

### Adding Your Project to GitHub

Initialize a Git repository in your project folder (if not already initialized):  
```powershell
git init
```  

Add all project files to the repository:  
```powershell
git add .
```  

Commit the changes:  
```powershell
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```  

Create a new repository on GitHub (through the GitHub website).

Link your local repository to the remote GitHub repository:  
```powershell
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
```  
Replace the URL with your GitHub repository URL.

Push your code to GitHub:  
```powershell
git push -u origin main
```
